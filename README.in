        MESSAGE BOARD LIBRARY (@PACKAGE_NAME@ Release @PACKAGE_VERSION@)
       
        
The Message Board Library (@PACKAGE_NAME@) is a data management and 
communication library developed for  multi-agent simulations generated using 
the FLAME framework.

As agents only interact with its  environment (and each other) via messages,
the Message Board library  serves as a means of  achieving  parallelisation. 
Agents  can  be  farmed  out  across    multiple  processors  and  simulated 
concurrently,  while a coherent  simulation  is maintained through a unified 
view of the distributed Message Boards.

Synchronisation of the message boards are non-blocking as they are performed
on a separate communication  thread, allowing much of the communication time 
to be overlapped with computation.

Installing from a distribution file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Requirements: #####

You will need the following:
 * a C compiler, e.g. GCC 
 * GNU Make
 * libtool 
 * Doxygen (optional, to generate documentation)
   - available from http://www.doxygen.org

To compile the parallel version of the library, you will also need:
 * An MPI Library, e.g. MPICH             
   - available from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/
 * Support for pthreads                  
   - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads

To compile the unit tests, you will also need:
 * CUnit                                    
   - available from http://cunit.sourceforge.net/


##### Installation: #####

1. Configure the source using the ./configure script. This will prepare the 
   source code and check that all pre-requisites are met.
   
   [root@stfc]# ./configure
   
   -- Changing installation directory --
   By default, the library will be configure for installation within your 
   system (typically in /usr/local for Linux systems). This will allow users
   to link to the library without having to specify the library location.
   This however would require you to have administrator privileges (root).
   
   If you wish to change the installation destination (this may be necessary
   if  you do  not  have root  access, of if you wish to  maintain  multiple
   versions of the library), you can use the --prefix option to specify an
   alternative installation location. 
   
   [lsc@stfc]$ ./configure --prefix=/home/lsc/build/libmboard
   
   -- Disabling some components --
   You can disable the inclusion of unit tests (if you do not have CUnit)
   installed by including the --disable-tests option.
   
   You can also disable the compilation of parallel librarys (if you do not
   have pthreads and MPI support) by using the --disable-paralle option.
   
   -- More options --
   For more configuration options, run "./configure --help".
   
2. Once the configuration is successful, you can compile and install the 
   library.
   
   [root@stfc]# make 
   [root@stfc]# make install
   
   
For more details on installation, see the 'INSTALL' file.


##### Using the library: #####

For information on how to use the library, view the User Manual. The manual
can be generated by running "make doc". 

You can also browse the User Manual online at:

===============================================================================
++ Installing from Subversion (developer's version) ++
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Requirements: #####

Apart from the requirements listed above, you will also need:
 * GNU Autoconf (version >= 2.56)
 * GNU Automake (version >= 1.8)
 
 
##### Bootstrapping: #####

Before you can configure and install the project, you will first need to 
process the pristine source through GNU Autotools. This can be done by running
the following command:
  ./autogen.sh
  
Upon successful bootstrapping, proceed by following the installation
instructions above.


##### Creating Distributions: #####

From the developer's source tree, you can generate a distribution version by
running the following command:
  ./create_distribution.sh
