	* configure.ac m4/*.m4: Implemented better configuration checks for MPI and Pthreads
	* Makefile.am, */Makefile.am: Updated to match changes in *.m4 
	
	* include/*.h, */*.c: Headers (apart from mboard.h and uthash.h) renamed to mb_*.h to avoid conflicts with existing headers
	* Makefile.am: Only mboard.h and mb_objmap.h are installed
	
	* src/utils/objmap.c: Renamed map_t type declaration which clashes with those defined in AIX system header files 

	* Builds and runs fine on bglogin2 (Bluegene/P) - using cc defined by `mpicc -show`
	* Builds and runs fine on HPCx (IBM AIX) - tested with gcc and xlc_r
	* Builds and runs fine on HAPU (HP Cluster Platform 4000) - tested with gcc and pgcc

	* comm.c, tests/testsuite_commroutines/test_cr1.c: update to solve bug with board->locked status being updated prematurely.
	* src/parallel/*.c: removed checks on errno as they sometimes pick up values for non-blocking MPI routines.
	
	* m4/check_parallel, m4/check_testing: properly define export *_LDFLAGS and *_LIBS
	* configure.ac, */Makefile.am: now possible to override CFLAGS during 'make'
	* example/circles_mb/configure.ac, example/circles_mb/Makefile.am, 
	  m4/check_mboard: updated to reflect changes in main configure.ac and m4/*
	
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/*/Makefile.am: testsuites now have assertion enabled, and uses the debug versions of libs
	  
	* Builds and runs fine on Linux (tested with MPICH & LAM/MPI)
	* Builds and runs fine on Windows via Cygwin (tested with MPICH)
	
	* Tagged as 0.1.2-alpha
