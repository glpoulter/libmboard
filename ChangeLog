	* : Memory logging implemented. Activated using --enable-memlog.
	* include/sqlite3.h, src/utils/sqlite3.c: Added sqlite3 files for storing
	  memory usage.
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, src/utils/Makefile.am: sqlite3 built into 
	  binaries if Memory Logging is enabled.
	* src/progs/mboard-parse-memlogdb: Added program to generate graphs from 
	  memlog output. Installed when source configured with --enable-memlog

	* src/progs/mboard-config.in: Added script to provide users with required 
	  compile/link options, as well as to query parameters used to configure 
	  and compile the local installation of libmboard.
	
	* m4/utils.m4: Added collection of small utiltity macros.
	
	* src/utils/objmap.c: Improved performance.
	* src/utils/pooled_list.c: Improved performance.
	* src/*/MB_Iterator_Randomise.c: Faster randomisation.

	* m4/check_parallel.m4: Improved portability.

	* : Tagged as 0.1.5-beta

2008-08-08  Lee-Shawn Chin <shawn.chin@_NOSPAM_stfc.ac.uk>

	* src/utils/*.c, src/serial/*.c: Further removal of checks to errno (missed
	  out during previous update).
	* src/utils/objmap.c, include/mb_objmap.h: ObjectMapper is now thread-safe.
	
	* src/utils/tag_table.c, include mb_tag_table.h: TagTable implemented as 
	  utility to manage message tagging.
	* tests/testsuite_tag_table: Unit tests implemented for TagTable utility.
	
	* src/parallel/comm*, includes/*: Communication routines simplified (less 
	  optimised, for now). Better support for varios MPI implementations.
	* src/parallel/function_assign.c, src/parallel/comm.c: Message boards can
	  now be assigned with parameters of different size (however the function 
	  handle must still be the same).
	  
	* autogen.sh, example/circles_mb/autogen.sh: Added version checks for 
	  automake and autoconf.
	* example/circles_mb/configure.ac: Added option to specify libexpat 
	  installation path.

	* include/uthash.h: Upgraded from v1.2 to v1.3 (with minor modifications).
	
	* Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am: Added make targets for generating 
	  documentation ('make doc', required Doxygen) and running static analysis
	  on code ('make splint', requires splint). 
	  
	* configure.ac: Added --enable-memlog option to ./configure
	* include/mb_memlog.h, src/utils/memlog.c: Added initial routines for 
	  implementing instrumentation of memory usage (not fully implemented yet)
	
	* : Tagged as 0.1.4-alpha
	
2008-07-12  Lee-Shawn Chin <shawn.chin@_NOSPAM_stfc.ac.uk>

	* configure.ac, m4/*.m4: Implemented better configuration checks for MPI and
	  Pthreads.
	* Makefile.am, */Makefile.am: Updated to match changes in *.m4
	
	* include/*.h, */*.c: Headers (apart from mboard.h and uthash.h) renamed to
	 mb_*.h to avoid conflicts with existing headers.
	* Makefile.am: Only mboard.h and mb_objmap.h are installed.
	
	* src/utils/objmap.c: Renamed map_t type declaration which clashes with 
	  those defined in AIX system header files.

	* : Builds and runs fine on bglogin2 (Bluegene/P) - using cc defined 
	  by `mpicc -show`.
	* : Builds and runs fine on HPCx (IBM AIX) - tested with gcc and xlc_r
	* : Builds and runs fine on HAPU (HP Cluster Platform 4000) - tested with
	  gcc and pgcc.
	* : Builds and runs fine on SCARF (Based on RHEL4.4) - tested with gcc, 
	  icc and pgcc.
	
	* : Tagged as 0.1.3-alpha
	
2008-06-27	Lee-Shawn Chin <shawn.chin@_NOSPAM_stfc.ac.uk>
	
	* comm.c, tests/testsuite_commroutines/test_cr1.c: update to solve bug with
	  board->locked status being updated prematurely.
	* src/parallel/*.c: removed checks on errno as they sometimes pick up values
	  from non-blocking MPI routines.
	
	* m4/check_parallel, m4/check_testing: properly define export *_LDFLAGS and
	  *_LIBS.
	* configure.ac, */Makefile.am: now possible to override CFLAGS during 'make'
	* example/circles_mb/configure.ac, example/circles_mb/Makefile.am, 
	  m4/check_mboard: updated to reflect changes in main configure.ac and m4/*
	
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/*/Makefile.am: testsuites now have assertion 
	 enabled, and uses the debug versions of libs.
	  
	* : Builds and runs fine on Linux (tested with MPICH & LAM/MPI)
	* : Builds and runs fine on Windows via Cygwin (tested with MPICH)
	
	* : Tagged as 0.1.2-alpha

2008-06-06  Lee-Shawn Chin <shawn.chin@_NOSPAM_stfc.ac.uk>

	* : First version. Tagged as 0.1.1-alpha
