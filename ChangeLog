	* configure.ac m4/*.m4: Implemented better configuration checks for MPI and Pthreads
	* Makefile.am, */Makefile.am: Updated to match changes in *.m4 
	
	* include/*.h, */*.c: Headers (apart from mboard.h and uthash.h) renamed to mb_*.h to avoid conflicts with existing headers
	* Makefile.am: Only mboard.h and mb_objmap.h are installed
	
	* src/utils/objmap.c: Renamed map_t type declaration which clashes with those defined in AIX system header files 

	* : Builds and runs fine on bglogin2 (Bluegene/P) - using cc defined by `mpicc -show`
	* : Builds and runs fine on HPCx (IBM AIX) - tested with gcc and xlc_r
	* : Builds and runs fine on HAPU (HP Cluster Platform 4000) - tested with gcc and pgcc

	* comm.c, tests/testsuite_commroutines/test_cr1.c: update to solve bug with board->locked status being updated prematurely.

	* m4/check_parallel, m4/check_testing: properly define export *_LDFLAGS and *_LIBS
	* configure.ac, */Makefile.am: now possible to override CFLAGS during 'make'
