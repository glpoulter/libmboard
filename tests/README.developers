The current layout is not ideal. Creating new tests within a suite is 
reasonably easy but setting up a new test suite is not obvious. Given a chance
to start from scratch the workflow would be a lot more streamlined, but for
now we'll have to bear with it.

Adding a new test
=================

1. Choose the testsuite to add the test to. All files related to that suite
   will be store in the testsuite_SUITENAME directory.
   
2. Create a new .c file. The recommended naming convention is test_TAG_FUNC.c
   where TAG is a keyword unique to the suite while FUNC is the function or
   feature you wish to test.
   
   Do no follow the test_TAG<n>.c naming scheme used in older test suites. 
   Those are a result of an unfortunate oversight during initial development
   that makes looking for test functions a nightmare. 

   (Alternatively, if your new test is is related to previous tests, you may 
   choose to add the test function into an existing .c file. If so, skip to 
   step 4)

3. Modify Makefile.am by adding the new file to the lib_t_SUITENAME_la_SOURCES
   entry. This will ensure that your new files is included in the compilation
   process.
   
4. Write your function. Make sure the header_SUITENAME.h header file is include
   in your source.
   
5. Add the function prototype to header_SUITENAME.h

6. Add the function name and description to the TAG_test_array[] definition in 
   the setup_suite_SUITENAME.c file.
   

Creating a new test suite
=========================

1. Create the testsuite directory. The standard naming convention is 
   testsuite_SUITENAME where SUITENAME is a unique name that identifies your
   suite.
   
2. Populate the directory with the following files. Use similar files from
   other test suites as a template and make the necessary changes. You will 
   need to replace occurrences of the suite name to SUITENAME. Also note that
   the Makefile.am for parallel and serial tests are slightly different.  
   - Makefile.am
   - header_SUITENAME.h
   - setup_suite_SUITENAME.c
   
   
3. Modify ${ROOTDIR}/tests/Makefile.am and add your new test suite directory 
   to SUBDIRS. Also add the appropriate lib_t_SUITENAME.la to one of the 
   run_test_*_LDADD entries.
   
   If you want your test code to be analysed when "make splint" is called 
   (recommended), you will also need to add SUITENAME to either the 
   SERIAL_TESTSUITES or PARALLEL_TESTSUITES.

4. Modify ${ROOTDIR}/tests/testing.h and include your testsuite_TAG routine
   as defined in setup_suite_TAG.c
   
5. Add an entry for your test suite to ONE of the test runner programs: 
   - ${ROOTDIR}/tests/run_test_utils.c (tests for utility modules)
   - ${ROOTDIR}/tests/run_test_serial.c (tests for serial libmboard API)
   - ${ROOTDIR}/tests/run_test_parallel_utils.c (tests for parallel utilities)
   - ${ROOTDIR}/tests/run_test_parallel.c (tests for parallel libmboard API)
   
6. Define the setup and tear-down code for you suite within the init_TAG and 
   clean_TAG routines in the setup_suite_SUITENAME.c file 

7. Modify ${ROOTDIR}/configure.ac. Add tests/testsuite_SUITENAME/Makefile to
   the AC_OUTPUT definition. This will be somewhere near the bottom of the
   file.
   
8. You can now proceed by adding tests to your suite. See instructions above.
