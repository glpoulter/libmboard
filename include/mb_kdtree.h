/*! \defgroup KDTREE Utility: Balanced k-d Tree
 *
 * This is our implementation of a balanced k-d tree [Freidman et al, (1977).
 * "An algorithm for finding best matches in logarithmic expected time.",
 * ACM Trans. Math. Softw., 3:209â€“226.] representation of messages within the
 * board to allow fast filtering of the board based on a desired search area.
 *
 * The following approach is limited to a 2D and 3D search, although an
 * implementation which supports arbitrary dimensions is possible. That shall
 * be the domain of future updates.
 *
 * \TODO Extend our kd-tree implementation to support arbitrary dimensions.
 *
 *
 * \TODO Consider using a not-so-balanced kd-tree to save on the expensive
 * median-finding sorts. Perhaps consider only a random subset of points for
 * median calculation to get an approximation.
 *
 * \warning This utility was NOT designed to be thread-safe and should never
 * be accessed concurrently.
